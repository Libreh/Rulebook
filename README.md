# Rulebook
A server-side rules screening mod for Fabric.

Supports [Placeholder API](https://placeholders.pb4.eu/user/general/), [Simplified Text Format](https://placeholders.pb4.eu/user/text-format/), and per player permissions with [LuckPerms]([https://github.com/LuckPerms/LuckPerms](https://github.com/LuckPerms/LuckPerms)).

## Commands (and permissions):
- `/rulebook` and `/rules` - Displays the rules in chat (`rulebook.main`, available by default)
- `/rulebook reload` - Relods configuration (requires `rulebook.reload`)
- `/rulebook update` - Resets all players' rule status and kicks them, forcing them to accept the rules again (requires `rulebook.update`)
- `/rulebook update <players>` - Same as above but only for targeted players (requires `rulebook.update`)
- `/rulebook update offline` - Same as above but only for offline players (requires `rulebook.update`)
- `/rulebook accept` - Used for accepting the rules (`rulebook.main`, available by default)
